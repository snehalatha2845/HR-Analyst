# HR Analytics Dashboard

This project focuses on building an interactive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI. The aim is to provide meaningful insights into key HR metrics such as employee attrition, department-wise turnover, gender diversity, performance rating, and job satisfaction.

The dashboard enables HR teams and management to make data-driven decisions by identifying patterns in employee behavior, analyzing reasons behind attrition, and monitoring departmental KPIs. The dataset includes employee demographics, job roles, salary levels, and performance data.

Key visuals used in the dashboard include bar charts, pie charts, KPIs, slicers, and heatmaps. Filters allow users to drill down into specific departments, genders, or job roles for focused analysis. The project highlights the importance of leveraging business intelligence tools for better workforce management.
